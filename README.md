French word clock
==========
I came across an original way of displaying time in a design shop.
Once home, I wanted to reproduce this in Python :)
After some research, I found this existing English word clock https://github.com/mattohagan/word-clock, from which my code is largely inspired.

To run it on your side :
1. Install Python and Tkinter : sudo apt-get install python python-tk
2. Execute the Python file from the terminal (in the appropriate folder) : python word_clock_french.py
